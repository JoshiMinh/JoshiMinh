        Hey! I'm Joshi Minh—an undergraduate, multi-disciplinary maker blending software engineering, product design,
        and AI experimentation. I live for turning fuzzy ideas into cross-platform systems that feel intentional and
        joyful.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Android apps and responsive web builds to Windows tools and creative experiments, I care about the energy
        the work carries as much as the features it ships.
