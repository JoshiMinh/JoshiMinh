# 🍩 Donut.cpp

</div>

Inspired by [GreenCode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74FJ8TTMM5E&ab_channel=GreenCode) and the [original C code by a1k0n](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html), this project brings the classic ASCII donut and additional shapes to C++. While the core idea and code are not originally mine, I have enhanced and expanded them for greater versatility.

## Usage

Compile and run the code as you would any standard C++ file:

```
